# this file specifies additional tests to be run by the cluster regression system
 
# the format consists of two columns separated by a tab:
#   column 1 : the output filename
#   column 2 : the ghostscript/ghostpcl/ghostxps command line
# (the output filename is not included in the command line since it varies between normal cluster and bmpcmp runs).
# the execution of the command line occurs from a directory that has tests_private and tests as subdirectories, so specify
# the input file path accordingly.

# the output filename is what is reported when a difference is found, so it's a good idea to make it informative.
# as a guide the standard tests use the format "directory__filename.output device.resolution.banding(0/1)" 
# note taht slashes within the directory are replaced with __ and spaces are not allowed.

# a custom_tests.lst file can appear in any of the directories that are normally included in cluster tests.  what directory
# the file appears in determines which executable is tested.  recommended directories are:
#  gs  - tests_private/comparefiles or tests/ps or tests/pdf
#  pcl - tests_private/customer_tests or tests/pcl
#  xps - tests_private/xps

# any standard device can be specified, however only those that are readable by bmpcmp.c can be used with bmpcmp,
# this is currently ppmraw/pgmraw/pbmraw/pkmraw/pam/cups/pnggray/png16m/psdcmyk/psdrgb and non-cmyk bmp.

# all of the tiff devices include the current date/time in the file, resulting in a different md5sum for every run,
# so don't add any commands with those :-)

# testing double conversions (i.e. from ps to pdf to ppm) is not currently supported.
